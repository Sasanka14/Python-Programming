"""Write a Python program to evaluate a students's results based on marks entered for five subjects. 
The program should calculate the total marks, percentage, and determine the grade based on the following criteria: 
- A: 90% and above 
- B: 80% to 89% 
- C: 70% to 79% 
- D: 60% to 69% 
- F: Below 60% 
and display a remark using operators such as arithmetic,comparison, membership , identity and logical operators."""
